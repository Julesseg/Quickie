///
/// It reaches its surfaces two ways, deliberately. The **app** target mostly
/// doesn't name this module at all: its `AccentColor` asset carries `accent`, so
/// `Color.accentColor` and `.tint` resolve to brand purple — the ring and wash
/// (`ResultListView`), the backdrop glow (`RootView`), the breadcrumb pills
/// (`Capture`) all read the asset, which `check-brand-assets.py` pins to the
/// literals below. (The asset is not quite enough on its own: a `Toggle`'s
/// switch ignores the accent and renders system green, so `QuickieApp` also
/// claims the *ambient* tint once at the root — see ADR 0033.) The
/// **widget** extension names this module directly instead (`EntryWidget`,
/// `PendingQueryLiveActivity`), because it has **no** `AccentColor` asset — and
/// deliberately must not gain one: an accent asset tints an extension's every
/// surface by default, including the compact/minimal Dynamic Island, which ADR
/// 0033 keeps system-tinted precisely because it is shared chrome. Naming the
/// token per-surface is what makes that line drawable.
///
/// It lives in the folder synced into **both** targets (like `ActionIcons` and
/// `DeeplinkInbox`) because the brand is one brand: the widget extension
/// previously hand-copied the icon's gradients into `QuickieGlyph`, which is
/// exactly the drift this module exists to end.
///
/// The literals are hand-copied from `docs/brand/make-app-icon.py` — Swift can't
/// read the Python constants — so `docs/brand/check-brand-assets.py` re-derives
/// the palette from that generator on every full CI run and fails on drift,
/// naming the constant and printing the number to paste. It matches them **by
/// name**, in the exact `static let ... = Color(red:green:blue:)` shape below,
/// and fails loudly on a name it can't find — so renaming one here means
/// renaming its key in that script's `brand_palette`, and the check will say so
/// rather than fall silent.

    // MARK: - The provider-badge palette
    //
    // One hue per `ActionKind`, so a Result row's leading badge says *what kind of
    // thing this is* at a glance (issue #178). `ActionIcons` maps kind → hue; the
    // literals live here because they are brand, and because one palette is what
    // keeps the in-app rows, the Favorites grid, and both widgets on the same
    // badges (they render the same `ProviderBadge` from the folder synced into
    // both targets).
    //
    // Unlike the icon's palette above, these are not derived from anything — the
    // icon has no opinion about what colour a Snippet is. They are built to rules
    // instead, and `check-brand-assets.py` enforces the rules rather than the
    // numbers:
    //
    // - **One lightness for the whole set (OKLCH L 0.55).** Every badge carries a
    //   white glyph, so every badge owes it the same legibility: fixing lightness
    //   pins white contrast into a 4.5–5.4:1 band across all fifteen, and leaves
    //   *hue* as the only channel that varies — which is the channel that means
    //   something. It also makes the set read as one family rather than fifteen
    //   decisions, and it is why these are flat literals rather than an adaptive
    //   pair like `accent`: an opaque badge at this lightness sits correctly on
    //   both appearances, so there is nothing for dark mode to fix.
    // - **Chroma to each hue's full gamut ceiling, capped at 0.24.** Every hue is
    //   pushed as saturated as sRGB allows at this lightness — the vivid end of the
    //   dial (issue #189's prototype compared it against a muted set and this one won
    //   on distinctness). sRGB simply can't hold a vivid teal here (h~200 tops out
    //   near 0.09), so the cool arc stays quieter than the warm one and the set
    //   tilts warm — an accepted trade for badges that read boldly. The 0.24 cap
    //   only binds on the magentas, whose ceiling runs higher; it keeps the loudest
    //   hues from pulling clean out of the family.
    // - **Spaced by perceptual difference, not by hue angle.** Equal *degrees*
    //   crowd the greens (where a 20° step is barely visible) and waste the
    //   magentas (where it is obvious). These fifteen sit at roughly equal OKLab
    //   distance along the ring, so no two kinds are much closer than any other
    //   pair — the badges are as tellable-apart as fifteen hues can be.
    // - **Two arcs are off-limits, which is why the ring has gaps.** The accent's
    //   own hue (OKLCH ~290: `lightAccent` 289.7, `lavender` 296.4) is left empty
    //   so a badge never reads as a broken accent — the exact failure the old
    //   palette had, with a *blue* static-link badge beside what was then a blue
    //   accent. And `gold`'s hue (~84) is left empty because ADR 0033 spends gold
    //   in exactly one place, the Highlighted result's hero glow; a gold-ish badge
    //   would be the "gold as a secondary accent" that ADR explicitly rejected.
    //   The ring therefore runs 104°→255° and 325°→64°, and the badges flank the
    //   accent rather than competing with it.
    //
    // Ring order below, so the neighbourhoods are visible: the cool arc after the
    // gold gap, then the warm arc after the accent gap.
